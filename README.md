# code-challenge-1
My first project containing  assignment on code challenge 1 
That cointains the following projects
1.student grade calculator
  The input is between between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 
  A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
2.Speed Detector
 The programm  functions in a way that it takes input as the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), gives the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
3.Net Salary Calculator
     calculates an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.
